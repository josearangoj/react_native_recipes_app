# Recipes App

This is a recipe app designed to provide ideas to the user on what to cook. With two different kinds of search, you can find a list of random recipes if you don't know what to cook, or by using the advanced search you have specific ingredients in your stock and you want to find which recipes have those ingredients.

This app was developed using react-native with android studio. Redux library implemented. Two different APIs are implemented to retrieve the recipes.
